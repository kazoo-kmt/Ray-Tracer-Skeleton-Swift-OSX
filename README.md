# Ray Caster / Tracer in Swift

This repository contains the skeleton for a ray caster/tracer in Swift. You'll be using the same code base throughout the course of this class so it is important that you write clean code. We'll start off writing a ray caster that supports a perspective camera, primitives (spheres, planes, triangles), matrix transforms, phong shading, and texture mapping.

Once that is finished, we'll add some features and turn it into a ray tracer. The ray tracer will have a better shading model and recursively generate rays to support reflections and shadows. It will also support procedural texturing and supersampling.

# Overview of starter code

## Creating a RayCaster instance

The code provided in this repository handles a lot of the necessary grunt work. A `Scene` class has been provided that will load in each scene file and call each class' appropriate `init`.

A few constants are provided in `AppDelegate` that will allow you to change the scene file, width and heigh of output image, whether or not images are saved and toggle [octree](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.29.987) (acceleration structure that we'll discuss later on) usage on/off.

`AppDelegate` will immediately create a new RayCaster, parse the first scene in `sceneFiles`, and initialize the correct objects. It then calls the `render` method on this RayCaster. Your main ray casting loop should go in `render`.

## Object types

All objects exist in a `Scene` which has its own `Camera` `Lights`, `Materials`, and `Group`. A `Group` implements the `Hitable` protocol (`intersect` method) and contains all the `ObjectTypes` (which also implement `Hitable`. The `ObjectTypes` (subclass of `Hitable` protocol that adds a `Material`) we'll support are `Plane`, `Sphere`, and `Triangle` (`Triangles` belong to a `TriangleMesh` which implements `Hitable` and passes the ray down to its children). All `Hitable` types can belong to a `Transform` which will apply matrix transforms to its child.

## Math helpers

The code makes use of [`simd` vector and matrix types](http://www.russbishop.net/swift-2-simd). I have included a `MathHelper.swift` file with some methods to make your life easier. Some of these are just aliases to `simd` functions and others implement stuff `simd` does not offer (creation of transform matrices). Two common and well named functions that `simd` provides (so are not defined in `MathHelper.swift`) are cross product (`cross(a: vector_float3, b: vector_float3)`) and dot product (`dot(a: vector_float3, b: vector_float3)`).

## Depth image, normals image, shaded image

You can switch between your depthImage, normalImage, and shaded image using the `D`, `N`, and `I` keys respectively.

The shaded image is set up to show automatically once done processing. Early on, you'll want to modify the code to show the `depthImage` instead since we won't start generating shaded images until week 3.

# Week 1

## Camera, raycast loop, ray-plane intersections and depth images

### Set up the camera

Implement `PerspectiveCamera`'s `init` function correctly. `up` and `direction` are guaranteed to be on the same plane but are not necessarily perpendicular to each other. The direction of the `direction` vector should not change but use cross product to guarantee all 3 parts of your orthobasis are perpendicular to each other. Don't forget to normalize your basis vectors!
    
Once your camera is initialized, implement `generateRay` according to the lecture. Make sure that your `generateRay` uses normalized coordinates for your image plane (-1 < x < 1 and -1 < y < 1).

### Set up the ray cast loop

Now move on over to `RayCaster` and implement your ray cast loop. Loop over each pixel and generate rays to the point (you'll have to convert to the normalized coordinates that your `PerspectiveCamera` is expecting. All heavy lifting should be done in `raycastPixel` so that it'll be easier to parallelize your code later on!

For each pixel, generate a `Ray` with the `scene.camera` instance, an empty `Hit` and call `scene.group.intersect`.

### Ray-plane intersections

Now that we have our render loop set up, go implement the `intersect` method in `Plane`. This will automatically get called as the scene's root group iterates over it's primitives. See the lecture slides if you need help!

### Render depth to intersections

If there was an intersection, you'll want to save `t` to `depthImage`. `setDepthPixel` does this for you and also clips high `t` values automatically (check out `Image.setDepthPixel` and `Image.generateDepthNSImage` to see how this works.

Once your ray cast loop is down, call `processDepth`. See the hints below for more information on displaying it automatically.

### Hints

- Set `SCENES_TO_PARSE` to `SceneFile.planes`
- Image pixels are written from the top-left to the bottom right. Because of this, you'll probably want to follow the same convention in your ray caster loop -- (-1, 1) should map to pixel (0, 0).
- The RayCaster is currently set up to only automatically show the shaded image. You'll need to add `windowController.updateImageView(result)` to `processDepth` if you want it to show automatically. Otherwise, press `D` on your keyboard while the window is active to view it.

### Expected results
